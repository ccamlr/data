# MPA Planning Domains

version: 2024-03-07

The CAMLR Convention Area is divided into nine MPA planning domains. These were defined during the 2011 CCAMLR workshop on marine protected areas (SC-CAMLR-XXX, Annex 6).

The division into these domains provides a mechanism by which to plan and report on the development of MPAs and as a means to organise future activities related to this effort. The planning domains are intended to reflect the scale and location of current and planned research efforts in order to be helpful as reporting and auditing units. The boundaries of the planning domains are not boundaries of proposed MPAs and are not intended to confine or restrict research or other work to develop MPAs.

Domain 1: Western Peninsula – South Scotia Arc
Domain 2: North Scotia Arc
Domain 3: Weddell Sea
Domain 4: Bouvet Maud
Domain 5: Crozet – del Cano
Domain 6: Kerguelen Plateau
Domain 7: Eastern Antarctica
Domain 8: Ross Sea
Domain 9: Amundsen – Bellingshausen
