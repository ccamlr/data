# Small Scale Management Units

version: 2017-09-19

Small-scale management units (SSMUs) are designed to be used as a basis for subdividing the precautionary catch limit for krill in Subareas 48.1, 48.2, 48.3 and 48.4, and in developing management procedures for the krill fishery that can adequately account for localised effects on krill predators (SC-CAMLR-XXI, paragraphs 3.16 to 3.18). The boundaries of the SSMUs are based on predator foraging ranges (refer SC-CAMLR-XXI, Annex 4 and Trathan et al, 2008).
