**version**: v0.9

**version date**: 2023-07-20

In order to manage the commercial harvesting of Antarctic marine living resources in accordance with the 'ecosystem approach' that is embodied in Article II of the CAMLR Convention, the effects of fishing on harvested species (target species) as well dependent species and associated species need to be taken into account. In order to provide information of the effects of fishing on dependent species, CCAMLR set up the [CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program](https://www.ccamlr.org/node/73031) (CEMP) in 1989.

This dataset consists of a shapefile containing the positions of the [CEMP Ecosystem Monitoring Program Sites](https://www.ccamlr.org/node/83427).
