As part of a project funded by the CCAMLR Scientific Scholarship Scheme, in 2019-2020 a monitoring program using standard methods of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program was initiated in collaboration with the University of Jena. Parameters recorded of the Adelie and Gentoo penguin colonies nesting on Ardley Island are size of the breeding population, reproductive success and weight of the chick at fledging.","CreatedBy":"CCAMLR\\gary","CreatedOn":"2022-06-01T06:58:19.634Z","ModifiedBy":"CCAMLR\\gary","ModifiedOn":"2022-06-01T06:58:19.634Z"}}],"crs":{"type":"name","properties":{"name":"urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::6932"}}}
