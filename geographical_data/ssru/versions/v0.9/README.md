CCAMLR designed Small-Scale Research Units (SSRUs) to be used as a basis for subdividing the precautionary catch limit for toothfish in exploratory fisheries, and in conducting research fishing and developing stock assessments. The boundaries of the SSRUs are defined in [Conservation Measure 41-01](https://cm.ccamlr.org/en/measure-41-01-2023).

This dataset consists of a shapefile containing the polygons of the CCAMLR Fishery Small-Scale Research Units.
