# Statistical Areas, Subareas and Divisions

version: 2017-09-18

Statistical areas, subareas and divisions are used globally for the purpose of reporting fishery statistics. CCAMLR's Convention Area in the Southern Ocean is divided, for statistical purposes, into Area 48 (Atlantic Antarctic) between 70W and 30E, Area 58 (Indian Ocean Antarctic) between 30 and 150E, and Area 88 (Pacific Antarctic) between 150E and 70W. These areas, which are further subdivided into subareas and divisions, are managed by CCAMLR. A global register of statistical areas, subareas and divisions is maintained by FAO [http://www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en](http://www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en).

Data is a filtered subset of the source data from [FAO Statistical Areas for Fishery Purposes](http://www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en).
