# CCAMLR Marine Protected Areas

**version**: v0.9

**version date**: 2022-08-04

CCAMLR has agreed to develop a representative system of [Marine Protected Areas](https://www.ccamlr.org/node/86677) (MPAs) in the CAMLR Convention Area. The first CCAMLR MPA, and the world's first international MPA, to come into effect was the [South Orkney Islands southern shelf MPA](https://www.ccamlr.org/measure-91-03-2009); this was followed in 2016 by the [Ross Sea region MPA](#0).

This dataset consists of a shapefile containing the polygons of the Marine Protected Areas established by CCAMLR.
