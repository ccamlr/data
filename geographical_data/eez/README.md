# Exclusive Economic Zones

version: 2022-08-04

An exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is a sea zone prescribed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea over which a state has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources. Included are the EEZs that intersect the CCAMLR convention area. Some of these are currently in dispute.
